# WebScrapping
Web Scraping from Amazon Best selling books 

I used web scraping techniques to extract data from the Amazon website and compiled a comprehensive list of the top-selling books in the Netherlands for 2023.
This involved utilizing specialized tools to collect and analyze data from Amazon's website and organizing the information into an easy-to-read format. 
By extracting this valuable data, I was able to provide insights into the current book market trends in the Netherlands and identify popular themes and genres.
This project showcases my skills in data collection and analysis and demonstrates my ability to derive meaningful insights from raw data.
